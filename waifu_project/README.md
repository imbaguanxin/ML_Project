# Final Project Of DS4400

# Group member: Xin Guan, Ziqian Ge

# the pdf file "DS4400 final project report-Xin Guan-Ziqian Ge.pdf" is our report.

`neural_network.ipynb`: source code and visualization for resnet training

`resnet_traditional_models.ipynb`: source code and visualization for non-neural-network with resnet features models

`traditional_models.ipynb`: source code and visualization for non-neural-network models.


`data_cleaning.py`, `data_loader.py`: source code for data preprocessing.

Dependencies:

`OpenCV`, `Scipy`, `Scikit-learn`, `PIL`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `mahotas`, `pytorch` and `torchvision`.

Since our project is on image recognition, the runing of the source code is expected to take **large amount of time and memory**. In our practice, it takes up to 28g memories when training the models.
